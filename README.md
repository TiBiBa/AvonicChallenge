# Coding Challenge Avonic: Pokémon!
This repo contains a turn-by-turn console-based Pokémon game. The game itself is highly simplified to only contain the core functionality of the game.
It contains the first 151 Pokémons that the user is able to select as their main fighter. The Pokémon data is retrieved from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon?resource=download) Kaggle dataset. 
After selecting a main Pokémon and starting a battle a random opponent is selected.  The Pokémon with the highest speed starts. 
After the match is over you are free to battle again with any other Pokémon. Notice that your opponent will always be different from your Pokémon of choice. 
The damage calculation is loosely based on [this](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-damage-calculation-help-guide/) source and uses the following equation:
```
base_damage = ((((2 * level) / 5) + 2) * move_damage * (attack / defense) / 50) + 2
```
After calculating the base damage the critical hit change is calculated. When it's a critical hit the `base_damage` is multiplied by `1.5`.
```
Welcome, to this turn-by-turn console-based Pokémon game!
